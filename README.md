# mmWave-parking-solution-AWR1843AOPEVM-
This project involves a parking solution using a AWR1843AOPEVM, Nucleo board, custom PCB, and ground sensors (DRV5055). I used GitHub Copilot to generate Python code for sensor data processing, even though I had no prior Python experience. Itâ€™s a hands-on example of combining hardware with software to solve a real-world problem.

Technologies Used:
AWR1843AOPEVM
Nucleo board
Custom PCB
Ground sensors
GitHub Copilot (for code generation)


What I Learned:
How to integrate hardware and software.
How to use AI tools to accelerate coding.
The value of documenting complex projects.
