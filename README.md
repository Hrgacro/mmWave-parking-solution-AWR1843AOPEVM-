# mmWave-parking-solution-AWR1843AOPEVM-
This project involves a parking solution using a AWR1843AOPEVM, Nucleo board, custom PCB, and ground sensors (DRV5055). I used GitHub Copilot to generate Python code for sensor data processing, even though I had no prior Python experience. Itâ€™s a hands-on example of combining hardware with software to solve a real-world problem.
